# quarkus-demo

That repository is a placeholder hosting the code I demonstrate in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Jesebmini/videos). I have created that channel to start sharing knowledge and
more important, collecting feedbacks to continuously improve myself. I am not pretending that my way of coding is a way to go. It is just my vision and good practices that I have learned among my
personal experience.

Feel free to visit, comment and subscribe.
The coding language is Kotlin for that demo. 

## Getting Started

For each video, I will create a new branch and add a chapter in this README file. I will also update a table which resumes different branches.

## Summary table
